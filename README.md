## 📑 Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of customer churn data for a telecommunications company. The main goals are to understand customer demographics, service usage, and potential factors contributing to customer churn. Additionally, insights from this analysis will be used to tailor offers and strategies to enhance customer retention.

## 📝 Business Questions
The analysis aims to answer the following key business questions:
1. What is the gender distribution among our customers?
2. What percentage of customers are senior citizens?
3. How many customers have partners and dependents?
4. What is the distribution of customers with multiple lines?
5. Based on correlation analysis, which variables have a strong relationship with each other?
6. How does internet service type relate to the churn rate?
7. How many types of internet services do we provide, and what is the distribution?
8. What contract types are available, and what is their distribution among customers?
9. How many customers use StreamingTV, and what is the ratio of streaming movie viewers among them?
10. Is there a correlation between the monthly recharge rate and customers with dependents?
11. Who are the highest-paying customers in terms of monthly and total charges?
12. What payment methods are available, and how are they distributed among customers?
13. What is our current churn rate?
14. What is the average monthly charge across all customers?
15. Is there a relationship between senior citizens and monthly charges?
16. How can we design offers based on monthly charge categories?
17. What offer strategies could we use based on customer gender and partner status?
